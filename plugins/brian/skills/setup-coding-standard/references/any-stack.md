# Catalog: any stack

Each section opens with a blockquote saying when it applies and what to adapt. Everything after the blockquote is the section text for `CODING_STANDARDS.md`.

## Source text

> Applies to every repo. `styling.md` carries a third bullet for Tailwind repos.

- No code comments. Names and structure carry the meaning.
- Identifiers are spelled out in full. No abbreviations, no single-letter parameters.

## Grouping

> Applies to every repo. Keep the last sentence only when the repo runs a formatter that collapses blank lines (Prettier, oxfmt, gofmt, Black); otherwise end the section at "its own group."

Statements inside a function are grouped by goal: the lines that together achieve one thing sit next to each other, and a blank line separates one group from the next. Each branch of a conditional is its own group. The formatter keeps a single blank line and collapses runs of them, so the spacing is the author's responsibility and is reviewed like any other part of the code.

## Tests

> Applies to every repo that has, or will have, a test runner. This is the base section; `typescript-react.md` carries the text a React repo adds to it.
>
> Adapt: the placement paragraph holds where the toolchain leaves placement open (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python). Where the toolchain dictates it (Go's `_test.go`, Rust's inline test modules), state the toolchain's convention in its place. Replace `<source file>` and `<test file>` with a real pair from the repo; in a repo with no tests yet, use a real source file and the test path it implies. Extend the "Every utility function" bullet with the repo's shared-module directories when it has them (flyingsalmon: "whether it lives in a folder's `utils.ts`, in a file of its own, or in a shared module under `src/lib/`"). When an ADR in the repo depends on the no-tautology rule, cite it at the end of the second paragraph.

A test file sits in a `__test__` folder beside the file it tests and is named after it: `<source file>` is tested by `<test file>`.

A test verifies the behavior of its target, never how the target achieves it. A test that restates the implementation is tautological: it can only pass. A test that fails on a behavior-preserving refactor is a change detector. Both are worse than no test.

- Assert on what a caller can observe: the value returned for the inputs a caller passes, or the state change the caller relies on. Asserting that an internal function was called pins the implementation.
- Do not pin values no caller can observe, such as the shape of internal state or the format of an internal lookup key. Assert the property the caller relies on instead.
- Every utility function with behavior of its own is tested.
- Do not test a declarative artifact against itself. A reader sees exactly what it accepts, so a test that restates its clauses documents nothing a reader lacks and catches no defect, because there is no logic to get wrong. Test the code that consumes it, where the behavior is emergent.
- Write the expected value out by hand. An expectation computed with the code under test copies its bug and still passes.
- Run the real collaborators. Mock only what cannot run for real: network, clock, randomness.
- When output is unstable, such as generated ids or timestamps, assert the property that must hold rather than the exact string.
- If a behavior-preserving refactor forces a test edit, rewrite that test against the behavior or delete it. Do not patch the expectation.
